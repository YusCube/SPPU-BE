06/09 16:09:37	Agent-Freehand	I understand, whenever customer ends a webchat with us, an automated survey is triggered for the customer to give feedback of the conversation that you had with us
06/09 16:11:36	Agent-Freehand	if you are not happy with British gas service, you can raise a complaint on the following link - https://britishgas.co.uk/complaints
06/09 16:11:55	Agent-Freehand	Also if you let me know your issue as well, I can raise a complaint on your behalf as well
06/09 16:12:09	Customer	Firstly, British Gas, Such a waste of a supplier I have seen in UK. Billing customers based on estimated readings and when we provide the actual readings, the difference that come up is £150-£200 such of a fraud. Shame on you guys for having a bogus system and stealing customers money like hell where we earn them working long hours, I guess it’s the same with every single customer.
06/09 16:14:33	Customer	coming to gents, come on guys. We are not your friends when it comes to a professional chat, stop using short cuts. Come to social media platform will text shortcuts there, no one will question you. I don’t even understand what’s Quality and assurance or complaints team doing,  without checking the agent chats. Is this the way your support customer and is this customer service.
06/09 16:14:40	Agent-Freehand	"Really sorry to hear this
if you can give me an opportunity to check your account and make things right for you

Could you please confirm the email address for me ?"
06/09 16:14:53	Customer	let me finish this.
06/09 16:15:32	Customer	And unless a customer tells them, they can’t rectify what’s up in the system. That’s the way your website is designed.
06/09 16:16:29	Customer	They should be trained with complete product knowledge before hitting the floor. This will be a big issue for British Gas if they keep doing like this, they don’t even know the price difference and how they are categories
06/09 16:16:52	Customer	**how they are categorised.
06/09 16:18:33	Customer	Redundancy is one such of big mistake and those repeat statements, stop using them again and again. Understand what customer is saying rather saying that we don’t understand
06/09 16:20:03	Customer	you’re professional agents and being paid to support customer, just disconnecting chat wantedly and saying on customers face. Does you
06/09 16:20:41	Agent-Freehand	I understand, what I'll do for you is, I'll take this as as feedback and also have this recorded under a complaint as well for you
06/09 16:20:54	Customer	**just imagine if any one of a customer service agent do that to you when you’re discussing an important topic
06/09 16:22:16	Customer	how does that feel, i definitely feel bad and yes, I got the whole transcript and will be posting on social media with what has happened to me. This is not a joke, I am loosing my money. So, you feel good if you loose money?
06/09 16:23:28	Customer	Don’t worry Karan, I am going to raise a complaint from my end on Twitter. This should prove how fraud British Gas is doing to their customers, billing the,
06/09 16:24:24	Customer	*billing them based on estimated meter readings. Wow, lovely man..! Better come and take our cards and steal money from it directly rather doing this way.
06/09 16:24:43	Agent-Freehand	"I can raise this complaint for you, and being a floor manager, I'll make sure your feedback is heard, and we will work towards to improves our services and training as well

06/09 16:34:09	Customer	most of them
06/09 16:35:36	Customer	If you can’t then just let me know, I will take care of this from my end on social media.
06/09 16:36:47	Customer	I will definitely let other British Gas customers know how you’re dealing it based on estimated billing, and how you’re robbing us. This is such a big fraud.
06/09 16:36:47	Agent-Freehand	"I can help you, if the bill was estimated, we can cancel the bill which is issued on incorrect estimated readings
Issue a correct bill on current actual readings and if there's any credit balance after the new bill, I can check and refund back to you"
06/09 16:37:18	Customer	Yes
06/09 16:37:21	Customer	do that
06/09 16:38:14	Agent-Freehand	Please confirm the email address for me, I'll check it
06/09 16:38:26	Customer	Saik3076@gmail.com
06/09 16:39:17	Agent-Freehand	"Thanks for confirming Manoj
Please allow me a moment to go through the account for you"
06/09 16:43:14	Customer	Ok
06/09 16:48:22	Agent-Freehand	"Firstly, I would like to inform you that there's already a Complaint Number: 8012411746

And also I can see that we have issued you a new bill on current metering today and previous estimated bills were cancelled

The new bill is as follows
gas bill amount is £755.32 for 209 days and current gas balance is £215.36 debit
Electric bill amount is £575.35 for 209 days and current balance is £302.43 debit"
06/09 16:52:06	Customer	Boss, I know what I am looking at and what my bills are.
06/09 16:52:16	Customer	I said the same thing to previous agents
06/09 16:52:22	Customer	let me clarify this to you
06/09 16:53:00	Customer	my concern is what happens to the old payment which I made, which is £539.96 and £402.94
06/09 16:54:03	Agent-Freehand	It's all adjusted with the bill
06/09 16:54:16	Agent-Freehand	The payments that you have made is all with us and we have adjusted with the bill
06/09 16:54:50	Customer	then why is it still showing £215.36
06/09 16:57:32	Agent-Freehand	"Because, the previous bill which has been issued on the account, since the bill was due, and since the system didn't receive meter readings, the automated system estimated the readings and issued the bill

But the previous bill which was issued, the estimated readings was less than your average usage, due to which the bill amount was less

So when we received the actual readings, all the unbilled usage in the previous bills get added to the current bill"
06/09 17:00:30	Customer	But the thing is we have not been informed to submit the meter readings and that is what my concern is. So if I haven’t been told to submit the readings, how would we know that. Though we paid I without knowing we are being scammed
06/09 17:01:17	Customer	so to sum this up, we have been cheated and now who is responsible for my payments, is it you or is it British Gas
06/09 17:01:34	Agent-Freehand	"The balance which is on the account is for your energy consumption only
We haven't overcharged you at all

I'm just checking the notification setting on the account for meter reading reminder"
06/09 17:02:45	Customer	you Guys didn’t over charged me but cheated and stole my money
06/09 17:02:53	Customer	Which is complete fraud
06/09 17:04:29	Agent-Freehand	"Really sorry to hear this
We never cheat our customers

The amount you have paid us is just for your energy consumption, otherwise we don't charge anything else apart from that"
06/09 17:04:50	Agent-Freehand	If you are unable to pay off the balance in full, we can help you setup a payment plan with us
06/09 17:05:13	Customer	British Gas did cheat me,don’t say that they never did

Word affiliation, uncovering mental portrayals and associations of humans, has been generally concentrated in brain science. However, the size of accessible acquainted signal reaction words is harshly limited because of the customary physically gathering approach. In the meantime, with the huge accomplishment in (NLP) technique tasks, an extremely huge measure of plain messages can be effectively obtained. This proposes a knowledge about discovering affiliation words from the content corpus rather than physically assortment. This paper moves toward proposing a profound learning-based structure for programmed affiliation word extraction as a unique endeavor. The Framework comprises two phases of affiliation word identification and machine affiliation network development. Specifically, consideration instrument-based Reading Comprehension (RC) calculation is investigated to discover important affiliation words consequently. To approve the worth of the extricated affiliation words, the connection coefficient between semantic similitudes of a machine and human affiliation words is presented as a viable estimation for assessing affiliation consistency. The investigation further confirms that the machine affiliation words are for the most part steady with human affiliation words as for semantic likeness, which features the promising usage of the machine affiliation words, later on, explores both brain science and NLP.
